**Turn any cheap USB keyboard into a live loop station, drum machine, and synth rig.**  
No expensive hardware. No subscriptions. No cloud. Just your creativity.

## The Idea

Dedicated drum pads, MIDI controllers, and loop stations cost €80–€500.  
A USB membrane keyboard at a flea market costs €2.

**K3N Armoni Composer** makes every cheap keyboard a performance instrument. Plug in one keyboard or four — the system tracks each device independently at the OS kernel level via Win32 Raw Input, routes each to its own instrument role (Drums / Bass / Synth / FX), and lets you build layered live loops in real time, just like a Boss RC-505 but with zero specialized hardware.

> Built for bedroom producers, street performers, students in underfunded schools, and anyone who believes music should not cost money to make.

## Try the Interactive Demo Now

No build required. Open directly in your browser:

**[`preview/index.html`](preview/index.html)** — double-click or open with any browser.

The simulator includes:
- Full visual keyboard rig with color-coded instrument zones
- Audible synthesized metronome (40–240 BPM, adjustable)
- 3-track live overdub loop station (Record → Play → Overdub)
- Per-layer modular FX routing (Delay, Reverb, Low-Pass Filter)
- Custom audio file loader (MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG) — load any stem or track onto a key and remix it live
- Multi-deck switcher to simulate 1–3 separate physical keyboards
- Realtime canvas oscilloscope

## How It Works

```
USB Keyboard #1 (€3) ─┐
USB Keyboard #2 (€4) ─┤──► Win32 Raw Input WM_INPUT
USB Keyboard #3 (€2) ─┘         │
                                  ▼
                        RawInputHandler
                        (device path disambiguation)

            DeviceManager                 MappingEngine
          (role assignment)            (per-key sound routing)

                    ▼
            AudioEngine (C++ / JUCE)
            32-voice polyphonic sampler
            ASIO / WASAPI / DirectSound
                    │
                    ▼
            LoopStation (multi-track overdub)
            sample-accurate recording & playback
```

The critical technical challenge this solves: Windows normally merges all USB keyboard input into a single global key event stream. This app intercepts input **before** the OS merges it, at the Raw Input device level, allowing true per-physical-keyboard instrument assignment even with 4+ keyboards connected simultaneously.

## Key Features

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Multi-keyboard disambiguation | Up to 16 concurrent USB keyboards via Win32 Raw Input (`WM_INPUT`), each mapped to an independent instrument role |
| Event-based looper (`LoopTrack`) | Sample-accurate timestamped event recording with sorted timeline cursor scheduling ($O(1)$ block processing) |
| 32-voice polyphonic sampler | Pre-allocated voice pool with seamless voice-stealing on capacity |
| Built-in procedural starter kit | Synthesized 808 Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat, Sub-Bass, Acid 303, Moog Saw, Rhodes for immediate playability |
| Audio sample import | Lossless decoding of WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG into pre-allocated memory buffers |
| Modular FX architecture | Delay / Reverb / Low-pass filter routing per loop layer (implemented in preview simulator; native C++ DSP planned for v0.3.0) |
| Audio backend drivers | ASIO / WASAPI / DirectSound device management via JUCE |
| 100% offline | Zero cloud, zero telemetry, zero accounts |
| Prototype latency target | Sub-10ms target on low-buffer ASIO/WASAPI exclusive configurations |

## Build from Source

> **Note — v0.1.0 Preview**: The native C++ executable is currently being finalized. The interactive browser simulator in `preview/index.html` is fully functional and demonstrates the complete UX. Native build instructions are tracked in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)
- CMake 3.22+
- Visual Studio 2019/2022 with C++ workload, or Clang/LLVM
- JUCE 7 or 8 (fetched automatically as a submodule)

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/EtherK3N/k3n-armoni-composer.git
cd k3n-armoni-composer

# Configure
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Binary output: `build/LoopStation_artefacts/Release/LoopStation.exe`

For Docker-based isolated testing:

```bat
DOCKER_BUILD_AND_TEST.bat
```

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the full test suite guide.

## Roadmap

This is a community-driven project. The core architecture is in place; the roadmap defines what we build next together.

| Phase | Version | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core Engine & Hardware Layer | v0.1.0 | Win32 Raw Input, sampler, loop station, procedural synth | Preview |
| Metronome & BPM Quantize | v0.2.0 | Sample-accurate clock, snap-to-grid, swing/humanize | Planned |
| DSP FX Engine | v0.3.0 | Per-track EQ, resonant filter, algorithmic reverb | Planned |
| Studio Integration | v0.4.0 | Multitrack WAV export, MIDI output, Ableton Link sync | Planned |
| Cross-Platform | v0.5.0+ | macOS IOKit, Linux libevdev/ALSA/JACK, VST3/CLAP plugin | Planned |
